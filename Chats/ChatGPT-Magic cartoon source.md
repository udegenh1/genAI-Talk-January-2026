# Magic cartoon source 

## Prompt:
There is a cartoon on the internet showing a scientist standing
in front of a blackboard covered with mathematical symbols.
Somewhere (in the middle?) there is a text saying something
like “Magic” or a sentence with the word "magic". I’m not sure
exactly what the text in the rectangle says. Question: can you
find this image and tell me the source? Give me a link if possible.

You’re almost certainly thinking of **S. (Sidney) Harris’s** famous cartoon with two scientists at a chalkboard; in the middle of the derivation it says **“Then a miracle occurs.”** It first appeared in _American Scientist_ (Nov–Dec **1977**) and has since become a staple in science/math culture.

If you prefer a purchasable/printable version, Harris licenses prints directly via his site’s “Prints for Sale” page. [sciencecartoonsplus.com](https://www.sciencecartoonsplus.com/pages/prints.php?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

_(People often paraphrase it as “then **magic** happens,” but the original caption in the drawing is “Then a **miracle** occurs,” with the additional line below the panel: “I think you should be more explicit here in step two.”)_
