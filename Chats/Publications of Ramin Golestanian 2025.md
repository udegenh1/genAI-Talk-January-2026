# Publications of Ramin Golestanian from 2025

## Introduction

In 2025, Ramin Golestanian's research advanced the understanding of active matter and non-equilibrium systems. His publications primarily investigate how complex, large-scale phenomena emerge from local interactions. This work is unified by several key themes, including the paradoxical role of nonlinear non-reciprocal interactions in both driving chaos and stabilizing collective motion. Further contributions refine models of multifarious self-assembly and connect microscopic particle activity to the macroscopic hydrodynamics of active mixtures. This report synthesizes these findings, setting the stage for a detailed analysis of his contributions to modern statistical physics.

## Non-Reciprocal Interactions and Collective Dynamics

**Work in 2025 reveals that nonlinear non-reciprocal interactions can drive systems into a state of spatiotemporal chaos, while also paradoxically stabilizing collective motion against hydrodynamic instabilities.** This research expands the understanding of non-reciprocal systems beyond linear models, uncovering richer and more complex emergent behaviors.

A key development is the identification of 'effervescence,' a dynamic steady-state observed in binary mixtures with nonlinear non-reciprocal interactions (Saha, 2025). This chaotic state is characterized by the spontaneous creation and annihilation of phase-separated droplets coexisting with oscillating densities. This phenomenon, which can occur with or without an accompanying traveling wave, arises from the local, fluctuating restoration of parity and time-reversal (PT) symmetry within the system (Saha, 2025).

Further investigation explored the interplay between non-reciprocity and hydrodynamics in active mixtures suspended in a fluid (Pisegna, 2025). While emergent traveling waves—a hallmark of non-reciprocal coupling—are predicted to be linearly unstable due to self-generated fluid flows, simulations show a contrary result. Non-reciprocity was found to robustly stabilize these waves against such instabilities across a large portion of the parameter space, demonstrating its crucial role in maintaining coherent collective motion in realistic fluid environments (Pisegna, 2025).

## Modeling Multifarious Self-Assembly and Reassembly

**Work in 2025 demonstrates that continuous-time Gillespie simulations offer a more rigorous assessment of multifarious self-assembly, revealing instabilities that discrete-time Monte Carlo methods may overlook.** In studying equilibrium systems where multiple structures are built from a shared set of components, these simulations identified a smaller parameter space for reliable assembly than previously found using discrete-time methods (Metson, 2025). The discrepancy arises because continuous-time simulations more effectively expose the system's vulnerability to "chimera formation"—the erroneous assembly of hybrid structures—an instability that discrete-time methods are slow to capture, particularly in large systems (Metson, 2025).

These advanced simulation techniques were extended to model non-reciprocal multifarious systems, which possess the capacity for controlled disassembly and reassembly using the same constituent parts (Metson, 2025b). By comparing continuous-time simulations with previous discrete-time studies, researchers developed a more detailed understanding of the dynamics governing these shape-shifting processes. This analysis focused on pinning down the key mechanisms and timescales involved, including:

- The nucleation time for new structures.
- The interface growth velocity during reassembly.

Analytical calculations for these timescales were developed and validated against simulation results, providing deeper insight into how to program and control complex reassembly pathways (Metson, 2025b).

## Interface Dynamics and Hydrodynamics in Active Mixtures

**Research in 2025 establishes that spatial variations in surface tension can drive interface dynamics through capillary forces, while in active suspensions, particle activity and non-reciprocity generate tunable hydrodynamic stresses in the surrounding fluid.** Work on phase-separated binary mixtures developed effective equations of motion for sharp interfaces, showing that heterogeneities in surface tension create a capillary force that drives their movement even without hydrodynamics (Romano, 2025). This can lead to counterintuitive phenomena, such as small thermophobic droplets spontaneously migrating towards high-temperature regions due to these capillary effects (Romano, 2025).

In parallel, studies on multi-species suspensions of active Janus colloids connected microscopic dynamics to macroscopic fluid mechanics by calculating the hydrodynamic stress tensor (Tucci, 2025). This coarse-graining approach revealed how different forms of activity and interactions manifest in the fluid, showing that:

- For a single species, the resulting stress can be tuned from contractile to extensile based on the particles' self-propulsion and chemotactic alignment (Tucci, 2025).
- For multiple species, non-reciprocity emerges directly in the hydrodynamic interactions within the active binary mixture (Tucci, 2025).

## Future Directions in Nanomotors and Micro/Nanorobotics

**In 2025, Ramin Golestanian contributed to key roadmap articles outlining the future of nanomotors and micro/nanorobotics, emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration and a systems-level approach.** A major roadmap for next-generation nanomotors introduces the concept of ‘systems materials’ to describe interacting functional components across molecular to macroscopic scales (Chen, 2025). The goal is to inspire a paradigm shift in the field, advancing both fundamental understanding and practical breakthroughs (Chen, 2025).

A separate technology roadmap for micro/nanorobots, co-authored with Xiaohui Ju, addresses the gap between laboratory progress and real-world deployment (Ju, 2025). It identifies key challenges hindering widespread use and calls for interdisciplinary efforts to solve them. Critical areas identified for future research and collaboration include:

- Propulsion mechanisms and fundamental theoretical aspects
- Collective behavior and embodied intelligence
- Material design and scaled-up production
- Commercialization, regulatory, and ethical frameworks

This collective vision aims to accelerate development, positioning these technologies as essential tools for addressing grand challenges and improving quality of life (Ju, 2025).

## Conclusion

Ramin Golestanian’s 2025 publications significantly advance the physics of active systems by revealing how complex behaviors emerge from local, non-equilibrium interactions. A central finding is the paradoxical dual role of nonlinear non-reciprocity, which can both drive chaotic states like ‘effervescence’ and stabilize collective motion against hydrodynamic instabilities. Key contributions from this body of work include:

- **Non-Reciprocal Dynamics:** Uncovering how non-reciprocity simultaneously induces spatiotemporal chaos while robustly stabilizing traveling waves in fluid environments.
- **Advanced Self-Assembly Modeling:** Demonstrating that continuous-time simulations provide a more rigorous assessment of multifarious assembly, revealing instabilities like 'chimera formation' that discrete-time methods overlook.
- **Micro-to-Macro Connection:** Linking microscopic activity to macroscopic effects, from interface motion driven by capillary forces to tunable hydrodynamic stresses in active suspensions.

These theoretical insights inform a forward-looking vision for nanorobotics, establishing a foundational framework for engineering the next generation of intelligent, functional systems.
